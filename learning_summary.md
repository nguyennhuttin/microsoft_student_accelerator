Machine learning theory learned
1/ Preprocessing - As I use the bing image search to download lots of images, I notice that there error in the data (image is unreadable, missing data, uncorrected size, format) and these error prevent the code from running. This makes cleaning the data very important (delete error, fill in mixing data, fix, crop and pad data to make others). Corrupted data could also be misleading the training process 
2/ technique to improve training - I find that by augmented the data (croping padding rotating fix focus) the model is relatively better. I also notice not to overtrain as this will lead to overfitting the data (only work well with training data set). Augmenting the data helps a bit in preventing overfitting 
3/ Using pre-train model like resnet18 produce better and faster result applying transfer learning

1/ No code
learn how to build no code model using machine learning studio: create a workflow that implement each step of machine learning (choosing data, preprocessing, splitting data, training, validation, testing)
2/ Code
learn how to apply python into building a model (I use fastAI)
3/ Azure service
I learn about services that help make AI: creating chatbox using NLP service (no code) or API to build one own. I also use bing image search to gather data for training.
